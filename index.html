<h1>Hack the Farm!</h1>
<h2>Our People</h2>
<h3>Kody Rogers</h3>
<p>
The Head Hacker and currently only person actively working on Farm Hacks projects.

He has an Applied Physics Degree from the University of Regina and has been involved in the family farm in the Melfort area ever since he was born. Kody founded Farm Hacks to create mass market marketable open-source products that would benefits families like his own.
</p>

<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<p>
  Farm Hacks is driven by the idea of creating marketable open-source products for farms and rural communities. We believe open-source empowers our customers to extend and adapt our products to their unique needs.  While we're aware of the potential for clones, we're confident that our focus on quality, innovation, and community support will allow us to build a thriving business.
</p>

<h2>Current Situation</h2>
<p>
  At Farm Hacks, we're always looking to improve!  Right now, the Head Hacker is taking a deep dive into electronics fundamentals with the textbook <i>Learning the Art of Electronics</i>. This means temporarily shifting focus from major product development to building a stronger foundation for future Farm Hacks innovations.

  Follow along and see some of the cool learning projects on the Farm Hacks YouTube channel, https://www.youtube.com/@farmhacks, or substack, https://farmhacks.substack.com/.

  While there may be some small little gadgets that come out of this (the plan is for a learning project at the end of each section) the main goal is not development.

  The Head Hacker is also engaging in industry research and connecting with customers to better understand the needs of the agriculture community.  Farm Hacks is eager to hear from potential customers and learn about the challenges you face on your farms. Reach out to kody@farmhacks.ca we'd love to connect!
