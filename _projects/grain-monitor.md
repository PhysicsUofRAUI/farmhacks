This is the main project and it actually has a functional prototype that has worked for the last two years, but right now parts are falling apart because it wasn't built well.

The main thrust of this project will happen after the standalone LTE-M monitor, and the current goals/problem areas are below.

1. Create a simple board/microcontroller circuit to read the sensor data.
2. Create a more resilient cable possibly by using a steel cable like that used for winches and wrapping it around the wire.
3. Create an app to remotely monitor the temperature in the bin from afar.

It is planned/hoped that a prototype can be ready for presentation for just after or before seeding and that a funding campaign can be run over the summer to clean up implementation and pay for a first production run.
