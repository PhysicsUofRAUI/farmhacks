# Basics
This project is planned to be a basic stepping stone to allow me a chance to learn more about the process of crowd funding and to learn more about MQTT and hardware development.

I will be a temperature sensor that can be placed within the reach of a wifi connection and will report the temperature and send a alert if it drops or rises more than a specified amount.

# Tech Projected to Be Used
- WiFi for connectivity
- MQTT as the transport layer
- Android or IOS app for the user interaction and alerts.

# Other Problems to be Solved
This product will be entering an arena which has a few competitors that do a very similar thing. To have this stand out a compelling reason/difference should be found and exemplified.
