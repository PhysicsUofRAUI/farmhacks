# Basics
This project is planned to be a basic stepping stone to allow me a chance to learn more about the process of crowd funding and to learn more about MQTT and hardware development.

I will be a temperature sensor that can be placed within the reach of a wifi connection and will report the temperature and send a alert if it drops or rises more than a specified amount.

# Tech Projected to Be Used
- WiFi for connectivity
- MQTT as the transport layer
- Android or IOS app for the user interaction and alerts.

# Proposed Time For Investor Prototype
January 2024 is the planned date for a crowdfunding launch, so the investor ready prototype needs to be ready for then. This might end up being a very pretty version of the Arduino Prototype if needed.

# Prototype Order Timeline
November 3: Arduino Prototype Finished
November 17: Order first version of non-arduino prototype.
November 17: Design a puck shaped 3D printed enclosure to hold the prototype.
December 1: Receive non-Arduino prototype
December 8: Evaluated the non-Arduino prototype and order board fixing any problems.
December 29: Receive second version of prototype.
January 6: Launch Crowdfunding campaign

# Other Problems to be Solved
This product will be entering an arena which has a few competitors that do a very similar thing. To have this stand out a compelling reason/difference should be found and exemplified.
