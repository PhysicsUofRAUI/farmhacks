The old version of the Grain Monitor was redeployed with the currently working 2 cables. The two cables are currently not working, but that might be due to the use of a too large pull up resistor.

The previous resistor will be checked (the board is practically fried but was previously working), and that value or lower will be used. Gorilla tape or strain reliefs may be added to give extra moisture protection (right now it is more or less just he box with the holes facing down).

The PCB temperature is reporting so I assume everything is working except for the cables.
