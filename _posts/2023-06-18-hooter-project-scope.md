This goal of this project is to make a retrofit kit that one can use to make a regular plastic owl into a hooting owl. The owl will give off a short hooting sound if something comes within 2 feet of it. The owl will be designed to operate without needing new batteries for one year. The kit will be easy enough to put together such that a begginer electronic hobbyist or a motivated bird scarer can put it together.

To recap the primary goals are (listed from most to least important):
1. To make a hooting sound when something comes within 2 feet.
2. To last one year without changing batteries.
3. To be easy enough to put together that a begginer electronic hobbyist or motivated hands on person can put it together.

Any adjustments to these goals will be described below and in its own post.
