A simple circuit using an Arduino Uno, a buzzer, and a HC-SR04 was created so the buzzer buzzes whenever something is about 30cm away from the HC-SR04 sensor.

A demo can be seen [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CtA3pzkAzKq/), and the code will be stored [here](https://github.com/PhysicsUofRAUI/hooting_owl).
